1. In IglooScore2, on line 58, it is impossible to reach full coverage if args is both checked for null and args.length is checked for 3. Fixed by removing args null check.

2. In IglooScore1, it would not correctly calculate the the smallest score. I changed line 38 to correctly determine the right smallest score.

3. In IglooScore2, on line 43, score2 should be score3. I replaced this.

4. In IglooScore2, in some cases, it would return 198. I made sure these cases did not happen by replacing line 48 and 49.
